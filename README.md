# Image-registration-and-affine-transformations-in-image-processing
By proper geometric transformation, we placed the images of Barbara, Lena, and Girl on three sides of the cube image. We performed geometric transformations using nearest-neighbor interpolation and two-line interpolation.
In the second part, we considered the Map 1 image as a reference image and matched the Map2 image to it.
This image processing project is written in Python.
